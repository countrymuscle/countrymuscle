  <h1>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ About Country Muscleâ„¢</h1>

  <p><strong>Country Muscleâ„¢</strong> was built on grit, faith, and the belief that strength goes deeper than just the gym. We're not here to get rich - we're here to build a brand that gives back, lifts others up, and represents small-town pride with big-time purpose.
    Every shirt sold helps fund the next drop, support local businesses, or bless someone chasing purpose through hard work. We reinvest into growth - not greed - because we believe a stronger community makes a stronger brand.
